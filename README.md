# First-Projects
- Just some of the first python programs I made. These programs are easy to understand, and don't require any special libraries. 


## Crapjack.py

###### Simple game I made that tries to be a one player black jack games.
  
  - Does not recognize soft cards, does not allow for splitting.
  
  - Does not save amount of money in between sessions. This requires having money pulled from a 
    csv file. Not hard to do, but then the program wouldn't be one file.


## GoFish.py

###### Game that allows you to play go fish with a computer.
  
  - There shouldn't be anything wrong. 
  

## Madlibs.py

###### Game that lets you play 3 different mad libs stories.

  - There shouldn't be anything wrong. 


## Palindrome.py 

###### Simple checker to see if your word is a palindrome.

  - There shouldn't be anything wrong.


## Password.py 

###### Program that let's you input a password and then guesses it.

  - The guessing is just brute force of every combination of characters 
  possible.
  
  - Password can be 1-7 characters in length. Password can contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and !, #, ?, @, -, +.
